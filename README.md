<h1>The Flower Game</h1>
<p>An animated version of Conway's Game of Life with aesthetics inspired by the lore of Destiny. <br/>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Click on a square to set it to alive (pink flower) or dead (green square). This will let you set the initial conditions of the game. </p>
<p>To run the game, click the start button under the grid. While the game is running, it will turn into a pause button, which can be clicked to pause the game.</p>
<p>To clear the grid, click the reset button under the grid. </p>
<p>This is a form of cellular automata, which is a simulation that applies a simple set of rules recursively for each iterations. The rules here are from Conway's Game of Life, as follows:</p>
<p>1. A live cell with less than two neighbors dies. <br/>
2. A live cell with two or three neighbors lives. <br/>
3. A live cell with more than three neighbors dies. <br/>
4. A dead cell with exactly three neighbors comes to life. <br/>
<p>The grid wraps around from top to bottom and left to right, so if something goes off of the edge it immediately appears on the opposite side, allowing simulation of a larger grid than what is actually there as long as the forms do not collide into itself from the other side. </p>

<p>Any references made to Destiny are as a fan inspired by the lore. I do not own Destiny 1 or 2.</p>
